# Pokemon Sinjoh Editor

The Pokemon Sinjoh Editor is a multi-purpose binary rom hacking tool for Generation 4 pokemon games (Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Heartgold, SoulSilver) with the goals of speed, user-friendliness, and compability with decompilation hacks (including [HG-Engine](https://github.com/BluRosie/hg-engine)). The Sinjoh editor also aims to reduce the barrier of entry when it comes to ROM hacking, users shouldn't need to know teachnical knowledge of the data they're editing or worry about setting invalid values that lead to game crashes.
